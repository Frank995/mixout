# Implementation of Mixout with PyTorch
This repository contains a PyTorch code of mixout. This technique regularizes learning to minimize the deviation from the target parameters. For more detailed description of mixout, see "Mixout: Effective Regularization to Finetune Large-scale Pretrained Language Models" [[link]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.11299).
